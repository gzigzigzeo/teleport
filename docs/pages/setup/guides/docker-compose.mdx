h1: Run Teleport using Docker

We provide pre-built Docker images for every version of Teleport. 

These images are hosted on quay.io. All tags under `quay.io/gravitational/teleport` [are Teleport Open Source images](https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport?tag=latest\&tab=tags).

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=\&type=edition\&offering=community) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide. We currently only offer Docker images for `x86_64` architectures.
</Admonition>

## Pick your image

This table gives an idea of how our image naming scheme works. We offer images that
point to a static version of Teleport, as well as images that are automatically rebuilt
every night. These nightly images point to the latest version of Teleport from the
three most recent release branches. They are stable, and we recommend their use to
easily keep your Teleport installation up to date.

| Image name | Teleport version | Image automatically updated? | Image base |
| - | - | - | - |
| `quay.io/gravitational/teleport:(=version=)` | The latest version of Teleport Open Source (=version=) | Yes | [Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu) |
| `quay.io/gravitational/teleport:(=teleport.version=)` | The version specified in the image's tag (i.e. (=teleport.version=)) | No | [Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu) |

For testing, we always recommend that you use the latest release version of Teleport, which is currently `(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)`.

## Quickstart using docker-compose

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide.
</Admonition>

The easiest way to start Teleport quickly is to use `docker-compose` with our [`teleport-quickstart.yml`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/docker/teleport-quickstart.yml) file:

```bash
# Download the quickstart file from our Github repo
curl -Lso teleport-quickstart.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/teleport/v(=teleport.version=)/docker/teleport-quickstart.yml

# Start teleport quickstart using docker-compose
docker-compose -f teleport-quickstart.yml up
```

The `docker-compose` quickstart will automatically create a config file for you at: `./docker/teleport/config/teleport.yaml`.

This config is mounted into the container under `/etc/teleport/teleport.yaml`. It will also start `teleport` using this config file, with Teleport's data directory set to `./docker/teleport/data` and mounted under `/var/lib/teleport`.

By default, `docker-compose` will output Teleport's logs to the console for you to observe. If you would rather run the Teleport container in the background, use:

```bash
docker-compose -f teleport-quickstart.yml up -d
``` 

You can stop the Teleport container using:

```bash
docker-compose -f teleport-quickstart.yml down
```

## Quickstart using docker run

If you'd prefer to complete these steps manually, here are some sample `docker run` commands:

```bash
# Create local config and data directories for teleport, which will be mounted into the container
mkdir -p ~/teleport/config ~/teleport/data

# Generate a sample teleport config and write it to the local config directory.
# This container will write the config and immediately exit - this is expected.
docker run --hostname localhost --rm \
  --entrypoint=/bin/sh \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  (=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=) -c "teleport configure > /etc/teleport/teleport.yaml"

# Start teleport with mounted config and data directories, plus all ports
docker run --hostname localhost --name teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/data:/var/lib/teleport \
  -p 3023:3023 -p 3025:3025 -p 3080:3080 \
  (=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)
```

## Creating a Teleport user when using Docker quickstart

To create a user inside your Teleport container, use `docker exec`.

This example command will create a Teleport user called `testuser` which is allowed to log in as either operating system user `root` or `ubuntu`. Feel free to change these to suit your needs -
[there are more instructions above in **Step 3**](../../getting-started.mdx#step-34-log-in-using-tsh) if you'd like additional details):

```bash
docker exec teleport tctl users add testuser --roles=editor,access --logins=root,ubuntu,ec2-user
```

When you run this command, Teleport will output a URL that you must open to complete the user signup process:

```bash
User testuser has been created but requires a password. Share this URL with the user to complete user setup, link is valid for 1h0m0s:
https://localhost:3080/web/invite/4f2718a52ce107568b191f222ba069f7

NOTE: Make sure localhost:3080 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
```

The Web UI will be available at the displayed URL. 

(!docs/pages/includes/insecure-certificate.mdx!)

## tsh into your Teleport container

Finish signing up and creating your user using the generated link created previously.

[Download and install](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) a copy of Teleport locally. Doing so will install the `tsh` tool so you can interact with Docker containers.

Open a second terminal and issue the command:

```bash
tsh login --proxy=localhost:3080 --insecure --user=testuser
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  The `--insecure` flag is not recommended in production but can be used to bypass certain TLS and port requirements when testing locally.
</Admonition>

You will be prompted to enter the password and One-Time Passcode you created for your user `testuser`:

```bash
Enter password for Teleport user testuser:
Enter your OTP token:
9999999
```

After successfully authenticating you should see the following in your terminal:

```
WARNING: You are using insecure connection to SSH proxy https://localhost:3080
> Profile URL:        https://localhost:3080
  Logged in as:       testuser
  Cluster:            localhost
  Roles:              admin
  Logins:             root, ubuntu
  Kubernetes:         disabled
  Valid until:        2021-06-10 07:15:42 -0500 CDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

Running the next command will display all Teleport Nodes you're connected to:

```bash
tsh ls
```

```
# Output
Node Name Address        Labels                          
--------- -------------- ------------------------------- 
localhost 127.0.0.1:3022 env=example, hostname=localhost 
```

To SSH into the local Node `localhost` (running in your Docker container) issue the following `tsh` command:

```bash
tsh ssh root@localhost       
```

This will bring up the Linux command prompt where you can issue Bash commands, traverse the directory tree, and explore the container contents:

```bash
root@localhost:~# 
```
