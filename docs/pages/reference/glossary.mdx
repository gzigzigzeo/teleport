## Teleport terms

| Term | Description | Link |

| Cluster | A Teleport Auth Service contains two CAs. One is used to sign user keys and the other signs node keys. A collection of nodes connected to the same CA is called a "cluster". | |
| Cluster Name | Every Teleport cluster must have a name. If a name is not supplied via `teleport.yaml` configuration file, a GUID will be generated. **IMPORTANT:** renaming a cluster invalidates its keys and all certificates it had created. | |
| Enhanced Session Recording | | |
| Join Tokens | | |
| Node | Synonym to "server" or "computer", something one can "SSH to". A node must be running the [`teleport`](cli-docs.mdx#teleport) daemon with "node" role/service turned on. | |
| Proxy | | |

| tctl | | |
| Teleport | | 
| Trusted Cluster | Teleport Auth Service can allow 3rd party users or nodes to connect if their public keys are signed by a trusted CA. A *trusted cluster* is a pair of public keys of the trusted CA. It can be configured via `teleport.yaml` file. | |
